### Java 17 instllation on Windows

https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk17-windows

### Java 17 installation on Linux

The best way to install Java 17 on Linux is to use the install tools. On Ubuntu you can install Java 17 with this command:

```
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre
```
Try replacing "apt" with your favorite package manager.

### Java 17 installation on Mac
Sorry, but I have no Mac available but you can try searching the web for it.
I guess something like "macos install java 17" could help.

Run the start.sh on Linux, start.bat on Windows

shell
```
someone@somewhere:~/jtpgt$ start.sh

shell (e.g. cmd.exe)
